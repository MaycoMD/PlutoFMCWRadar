The  FMCW  radar  does  not  require  a  large  transmit power to obtain sufficient value of signal-to-noise ratio for target detection process, such as the
radar pulses.


Pulse radar sends short pulses and determines distance by measure time delay between transmitted and returned signal. FMCW radar constantly sends out linearly
modulated signal and determines the distance based on the difference in transmitted and received frequency.
Measuring very short amounts of time in electronics is tricky, which means that it is very hard/expensive to build pulse radar with good range resolution. FMCW
radar can easily have range resolution of 0.5 meters, and cost below $500 in components.
Pulse radar are blind on short distances - typically 50–100 meters in front of the radar is “blind spot”. FMCW radars do not have this problem. For long range target
detection pulse radar is better, due to narrower bandwith and less noise.
On the other hand, if the target is moving, the movement creates doppler shift in the frequency of the transmitted radar wave. For pulse radars this is an added 
benefit, because the radar can also measure the relative target speed. In FMCW radar this is a problem, because the distance is measured by measuring the frequency 
difference between transmitted and received radar wave, and any additional frequency shift caused by Doppler effect of the moving target “shifts” the measured 
distance of the object. To overcome this, FMCW radars use several different modulation schemes (modulating with increasing frequency, then decreasing frequency, etc). 
If not mitigated by algorithms, or having very fast frequency changes, this effect can cause the “ghost” targets to appear on FMCW radar.


Las SDR presentan dos problemas para ser utilizadas como radar: 
1) No poseen un único oscilador local compartido para los bloques TX y RX, por lo que existe una diferencia de fase y frecuencia entre ambos osciladores. Una posible
solución es utilizar estampas de tiempo.
2) A diferencia de los radares donde primero se mezclan las señales emitidas y recibidas, en las SDR se mezclan una vez digitalizadas, en la FPGA, o en la PC. Esto 
hace que las cadenas de los bloques TX y RX inserten un delay en la señal, lo cual se traduce a rango en el diseño del radar. Una solución es medir y calibrar dicho 
delay.
